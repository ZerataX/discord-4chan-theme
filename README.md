# Discord 4chan theme
A [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.net/home/) theme that makes Discord look like a 4chan thread. As a bonus it also removes the Emoji button. As of 0.4.1 it also removes all emojis from chat.

Quotes work as well, by replacing inline code. Just use backticks:

\`>Some quote here\` 

To create code blocks you should use the triple fence notation:

\`\`\`css

code.inline {
    color: #789922;
}

\`\`\`
